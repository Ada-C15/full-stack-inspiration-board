# Stretch Goals

As a team, decide on one stretch goal from each layer.

Implementing the stretch goal is lower priority than implementing the project requirements.

## Front-end Stretch Goals

- Use React Router
- Allow the user to select how to sort the cards between these options:
    - Sort by ID
    - Sort alphabetically
    - Sort by number of "+1"s

## Back-end Stretch Goals

- Write tests for the CRUD operations around the Board model
- Every time a new card is made, it sends a message to the team's public Slack channel
